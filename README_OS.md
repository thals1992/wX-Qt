### MacOS
You'll need to be ok with installing (brew)[https://brew.sh/] on your system.
Another option is to install Qt directly from the vendor: (The Qt Company)[https://www.qt.io/download]
```bash
brew install qt
```
### Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
```bash
# unfortunately I did not record exactly what I installed
# but I think the following should work
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev
sudo apt install libqt5positioning5
sudo apt install qtpositioning5-dev


#
# NOTE for systems with less then 4GB RAM
# you should run the compile script with a call to use only one processing core
# as several very large source files can only compile one at a time
# instead of
./makeAll.py
# run the following to indicate to use 1 core onstead of 4 cores
./makeAll.py 1

#
# if this still does not work, try allocate 2GB swap
#
sudo fallocate -l 2G /root/twoGigSwap
sudo mkswap /root/twoGigSwap
sudo swapon /root/twoGigSwap

rm build/release/.obj/qrc_*
make

sudo swapoff /root/twoGigSwap
./run.bash

```
